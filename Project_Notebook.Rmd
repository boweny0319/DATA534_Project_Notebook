1. Read GitHub Activity API Document

2. Test APIs using Postman (All this API are tested for public information, results are stored in Postman) 

  + 2.1 List public events
      
      * Link: https://api.github.com/events
  
      * The "id", "type", "actor", "repo", "created_at" information can be formed as a datafream. We can use it to make some analysis like the number of activity for each type in a interval (to a datetime or last n records).
      
  + 2.2 List public events for a network of repositories
  
      * Link: https://api.github.com/networks/{owner}/{repo}/events
  
      * Example: https://api.github.com/networks/AndrewNg1891/DATA534_API_Project_Group9/events

      * Get information from certain network of repositories
      
      * The link explaned the meaning of network of repositories. (https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/viewing-activity-and-data-for-your-repository/understanding-connections-between-repositories)

  + 2.3 List public organization events
      
      * Link: https://api.github.com/orgs/{org}/events
      
      * Example: https://api.github.com/orgs/ubco-mds-2021/events
      
      * Similar information as above by only for certain organization.
      
  + 2.4 List repository events
      
      * Link: https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/events
      
      * Example: https://api.github.com/repos/AndrewNg1891/DATA534_API_Project_Group9/events
      
  + 2.5 List stargazers
  
      * Link: https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/stargazers
      
      * Example: https://api.github.com/repos/WestHealth/pyvis/stargazers
      
  + 2.6 List repositories starred by a user
  
      * Link: https://api.github.com/users/{username}/starred
      
      * Example: https://api.github.com/users/boweny0319/starred
      
  + 2.7 List watchers

      * Link: https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/subscribers
      
      * Example: https://api.github.com/repos/AndrewNg1891/DATA534_API_Project_Group9/subscribers
      
  + 2.8 List repositories watched by a user

      * Link: https://api.github.com/users/{username}/subscriptions

## 2022-02-14

1. Meeting with group and decide to implement events APIs first with some analysis. (Because we think this part would be more interesting and useful.)

2. Try to create a simple R package for testing package installation.

  + 2.1 GitHub repo name: boweny0319/testmypackage (commit e0a7e0bbea0c70f7d8941db76fba051f7972bca7)
  
3. Implement events API functions and test locally in "GitHub_Activity_API.ipynb".
