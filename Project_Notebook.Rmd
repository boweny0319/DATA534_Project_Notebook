# Project Notebook - Bowen Yang

## 2022-02-12

1. Analyze requirement documents.

2. Group meeting (divide project to sub-tasks).

3. Create repo with teamates during the meeting.

## 2022-02-13

1. Read GitHub Activity API Document

2. Test APIs using Postman (All this API are tested for public information, results are stored in Postman) 

  + 2.1 List public events
      
      * Link: https://api.github.com/events
  
      * The "id", "type", "actor", "repo", "created_at" information can be formed as a datafream. We can use it to make some analysis like the number of activity for each type in a interval (to a datetime or last n records).
      
  + 2.2 List public events for a network of repositories
  
      * Link: https://api.github.com/networks/{owner}/{repo}/events
  
      * Example: https://api.github.com/networks/AndrewNg1891/DATA534_API_Project_Group9/events

      * Get information from certain network of repositories
      
      * The link explaned the meaning of network of repositories. (https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/viewing-activity-and-data-for-your-repository/understanding-connections-between-repositories)

  + 2.3 List public organization events
      
      * Link: https://api.github.com/orgs/{org}/events
      
      * Example: https://api.github.com/orgs/ubco-mds-2021/events
      
      * Similar information as above by only for certain organization.
      
  + 2.4 List repository events
      
      * Link: https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/events
      
      * Example: https://api.github.com/repos/AndrewNg1891/DATA534_API_Project_Group9/events
      
  + 2.5 List stargazers
  
      * Link: https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/stargazers
      
      * Example: https://api.github.com/repos/WestHealth/pyvis/stargazers
      
  + 2.6 List repositories starred by a user
  
      * Link: https://api.github.com/users/{username}/starred
      
      * Example: https://api.github.com/users/boweny0319/starred
      
  + 2.7 List watchers

      * Link: https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/subscribers
      
      * Example: https://api.github.com/repos/AndrewNg1891/DATA534_API_Project_Group9/subscribers
      
  + 2.8 List repositories watched by a user

      * Link: https://api.github.com/users/{username}/subscriptions
      
      * Example: https://api.github.com/users/boweny0319/subscriptions
      
## 2022-02-14

1. Meeting with group and decide to implement events APIs first with some analysis. (Because we think this part would be more interesting and useful.)

2. Try to create a simple R package for testing package installation.

  + 2.1 GitHub repo name: boweny0319/testmypackage (commit e0a7e0bbea0c70f7d8941db76fba051f7972bca7)
  
3. Implement events API functions and test locally in "GitHub_Activity_API.ipynb".

## 2022-02-15

1. Implement events API functions and test locally in "GitHub_Activity_API.ipynb".

2. Create package structure

3. Create branch in group repo and push api functions to it (commit e9bd3e03f30255299d47d9e70b3eb9a0242600d5).
  
  + 3.1 github_api (helper function, send requst to api and return response)
  
  + 3.2 format_response (helper function, format response to list/dataframe/character/raw)
  
    * The dataframe type output would help user to make data analysis & visualization.
    
    * The list type output would help user to extract certain data, it is close to the json structure.
    
    * The character and raw type output provide flexibility to user, so user can using text/raw data to make format according to their need.
    
  + 3.3 github_get_public_events, github_get_organization_events, github_get_network_events, github_get_repo_events are 4 functions to access 4 events related API. 
  
  + 3.4 github_lastn_events_df is a function that can help user deal with pagination problem. User can easily place the number events they want, function will handle the pagination. The function will return data in dataframe type, which could provide convience to users on analysis.
  
  + 3.5 github_count_events_bytype,github_count_events_bydate,github_count_events_byweekday are 3 statistic function that using the result of github_lastn_events_df. The github_count_events_byweekday have plot option.
  
  
## 2022-02-16

1. Rough function documentations were added in last night commit.

2. Add inline comments to meet project requirement.

3. Demo API functions to group members.

4. Meeting with Professor Yves and group member, demo current implementation to them.

5. Implemented api_rate_limit function for "Best practices for API packages" (commit 2d4dc71dc54ba21526ed69611c28a8739f6959f9)
